            We organize meetups with other furries in the area, make crafts,
            draw art together, and go to conventions. We have a community of
            Stanfurs and organize events with other furries in the Bay Area.

          <p>
            We advertise and plan campus-wide events throughout the school year!
            In terms of chatting, we're most active on <b>Discord</b>. To access
            a link, you'll need to attend one of our in-person events or get an
            invitation from a current member. Alternatively, if you want to meet
            more furries in the area, join our Telegram group! You don't have to
            be a furry to joinâ€“if you want to see what it's all about, stop by.
            We guarantee you'll have a paw-some time :3
